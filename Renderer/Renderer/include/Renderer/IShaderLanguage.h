		*
		*  @return
		*    The created vertex shader, a null pointer on error. Release the returned instance if you no longer need it.
		*
		*  @remarks
		*    "profile" is not supported by each shader-API and is in general shader-API dependent. GLSL doesn't have such
		*    profiles, just something named "version" - one has to directly write into the shader. But even when this information
		*    is not used for compiling the GLSL shader, we highly recommend to provide GLSL version information in the form of e.g.
		*    "130" for OpenGL 3.0 shaders ("#version 130"). Within Cg, a basic vertex profile may be "arbvp1" and a basic
		*    fragment profile "arbfp1". Cg also provides GLSL profiles: "glslv" for vertex shader, "glslg" for geometry shader and
		*    "glslf" for fragment shader.
		*    Please note that the profile is just a hint, if necessary, the implementation is free to choose another profile.
		*    In general, be carefully when explicitly setting a profile - when using Cg, and one of the shaders, a GPU program
		*    is composed of, is a GLSL profile like "glslv", all other shaders must use GLSL profiles as well!
		*
		*   "entry" is not supported by each shader-API. GLSL doesn't have such an user defined entry point and the main
		*   function must always be "main". Cg supports entry points with names other than "main".
		*
		*   Look out! When working with shaders you have to be prepared that a shader may work on one system, but fails to even
		*   compile on another one. Sadly, even if there are e.g. official GLSL specifications, you can't be sure that every
		*   GPU driver is implementing them in detail. Here are some pitfalls which already produced some headaches...
		*
		*   When using GLSL, don't forget to provide the #version directive! Quote from
		*     "The OpenGL® Shading Language - Language Version: 3.30 - Document Revision: 6 - 11-Mar-2010" Page 14
		*       "Version 1.10 of the language does not require shaders to include this directive, and shaders that do not include
		*        a #version directive will be treated as targeting version 1.10."
		*   It looks like that AMD/ATI drivers ("AMD Catalyst™ 11.3") are NOT using just version 1.10 if there's no #version directive, but a higher
		*   version... so don't trust your GPU driver when your GLSL code, using modern language features, also works for you without
		*   #version directive, because it may not on other systems! OpenGL version and GLSL version can be a bit confusing, so
		*   here's a version table:
		*     GLSL #version    OpenGL version    Some comments
		*     110              2.0
		*     120              2.1
		*     130              3.0               Precision qualifiers added
		*                                        "attribute" deprecated; linkage between a vertex shader and OpenGL for per-vertex data -> use "in" instead
		*                                        "varying"/"centroid varying" deprecated; linkage between a vertex shader and a fragment shader for interpolated data -> use "in"/"out" instead
		*     140              3.1
		*     150              3.2               Almost feature-identical to Direct3D Shader Model 4.0 (Direct3D version 10), geometry shader added
		*     330              3.3               Equivalent to Direct3D Shader Model 4.0 (Direct3D version 10)
		*     400              4.0               Tessellation control ("Hull"-Shader in Direct3D 11) and evaluation ("Domain"-Shader in Direct3D 11) shaders added
		*     410              4.1
		*     420              4.2               Equivalent to Direct3D Shader Model 5.0 (Direct3D version 11)
		*  #version must occur before any other statement in the program as stated within:
		*    "The OpenGL® Shading Language - Language Version: 3.30 - Document Revision: 6 - 11-Mar-2010" Page 15
		*      "The #version directive must occur in a shader before anything else, except for comments and white space."
		*  ... sadly, this time NVIDIA (driver: "266.58 WHQL") is not implementing the specification in detail and while on AMD/ATI drivers ("AMD Catalyst™ 11.3")
		*  you get the error message "error(#105) #version must occur before any other statement in the program" when breaking specification,
		*  NVIDIA just accepts it without any error.
		*
		*  Enough on GLSL - now to Cg. Sadly, in general Cg is on AMD/ATI GPU's just poor due to the lack of modern profiles. When using Cg on none NVIDIA
		*  GPU's you have virtually no other change then using the GLSL profiles in order to write shaders using modern features. While the concept of Cg is
		*  fantastic, this lack of modern none NVIDIA profiles destroys many of Cg's advantages...
